            <h2>facts about dogs</h2>
            <article>This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have. Why are dogs’ noses wet? There are a
            few reasons for this. One is that the thin layer of mucus on their nose helps them capture and absorb scent (scent
            particles stick better to a wet nose than to a dry one), and then use their amazing 100-300 million olfactory receptors
            to identify and process the identity of that scent. That is aided by licking their noses (which also makes them wet) to
            bring the scent from their nose to the Jacobson organ that opens onto the roof of their mouth which can detect
            ‘undetectable’ odours like pheromones.</article>
            <aside>In an interview in 2013, Paul McCartney said that he added a frequency only dogs can hear to the end of the Beatles song
            ‘A Day in the Life’. So watch your dog when you play the song! It may even be true! How’s that for an amazing dog fact?</aside>
